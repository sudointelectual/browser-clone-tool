# Chrome browser profile Launcher, Cloner, Versioning Tool

This tool uses Zenity Linux native GUI library along with Python to clone, launch or version different chrome & chrome-like browsers profiles.

Why do this?
To keep several browser profiles, log-ins, cookies, cache, addons totally separate from each other. Unlimited cloning, and versioning of profiles. Very useful for me. I use it daily, very useful for log-ins and versioning or testing with addons.

 - Written for Linux platform.  
 - Brave browser can be swapped out for
   other chromium based browsers.  
 - Works on Chrome, Brave, Chromium, Opera etc. Just swap out the
   command eg. `brave-browser` for `chromium` or `google-chrome` in the
   script.
 - Change `main_dir = '/path/to/desired/folder'` variable to to the path where you want your browser profiles to live.
 - Launch this script from a keybind or script launcher
